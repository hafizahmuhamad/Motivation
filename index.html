	<p> As we know motivation is important to an individual for achieve their ambitions. Motivation in education can have a dramatic impact on student's performance and results.  As a student, motivation can be describe as an <i>engine of learning </i>. It can influence what we learn, how we learn and when we choose to learn. Finding the motivation to study can sometimes be difficult. If you are thinking about your education down this route, then it is important to you should know how to stay motivated in order to complete your studies. So, <mark> try to understand what motivation means to you then you can find your way to get motivated </mark>. For instance, motivation can help me to: 

<ul>
<li type="disc"> <b> undertake challenging activities.</b>
<li type="disc"> <b> enjoy and adopt a deep approach to learning.</b> 
<li type="disc"> <b> pay attention towards task that need to be done.</b> 
<li type="disc"> <b>enchance my performance. </b>
</ul></li>

<p> Most importantly, motivation need us to perform an action. Without it, completing the action can be hard or even impossible!

	<p> Since I need to start learn from home and attend online class, my parents is one of my motivation booster. They play their role very well to encourage me to stay motivate and energize. For examples, they will provide any learning material for me, they also actively listening when I have something to share and they will always encouraging me to complete any homework or study for a test. So, I think parental involvement has a positive impact on the success and performance in education. In addition 
	<i> the research also suggest that parent's involvement has a far greater effect on a child's development.</i>

	<p> Motivational self-talk also can be a motivation booster for me because it is a way of guiding, motivating and help to regulate our emotions. When we have positive internal dialogue in our brain, it can help ourself become more productive and boost our physical and mental well-being. For example, when I feel down in my studying, I will talk to myself <i> <q>If I want to achieve my ambition, I need to work hard for that because no one is going to do this for me except myself.</i> </q> With this simple phrases it can change our mindset to be more motivate.

<h1 style="background-color: paleturquoise"> 4) Peers Support
	</h1></center>

<font face="arial unicode ms" color="black" size="+2">	
	
	<p> Studying online can be boring, but there is no reason for me to feel unmotivated. I usually asking for advice from my buddies. They will help encourage me by saying "you can do it!" whenever I feeling stuck. An advice and reminder from them to me can boost my motivation to study hard. I am totally grateful because my budies is willing to help me. They will always ask me to join a group discussion through online. So, to make online learning become more interesting, we are connected through modern technology. For example, we are using WhatsApp and Zoom as medium to remind each other, discuss any assignments or share problems.
